Refresher is pull to refresh library written in Swift. It provides easy to use UIScrollView methods to add pull to refresh to your view. 
Refresher also supports custom animations.

##Usage

###Basic usage

```swift
tableView.addPullToRefreshWithAction {
	NSOperationQueue().addOperationWithBlock {
    	sleep(2)
        NSOperationQueue.mainQueue().addOperationWithBlock {
        	self.tableView.stopPullToRefresh()
        }
    }
}
```

###Custom animations

Refresher supports custom animations on `PullToRefreshView`. You need to create object that conforms to `PullToRefreshViewAnimator` protocol.
Then, just pass your custom animator in `addPullToRefrshWithAction`:

```swift
tableView.addPullToRefreshWithAction({           
  	NSOperationQueue().addOperationWithBlock {
   		sleep(2)
        NSOperationQueue.mainQueue().addOperationWithBlock {
        	self.tableView.stopPullToRefresh()
        }
    }
}, withAnimator: CustomAnimator())
```

Required methods that your custom object need to implement are:

*   `func startAnimation()` - Called when user release finger from phone and when loading actually starts. Here you need to start your animations.
*   `func stopAnimation()` - Called when loading is over. Stop your animations here.
*   `func changeProgress(progress: CGFloat)` - Called when user is pulling view. If you want to implement some progress like behaviour on pull this method is called.
*   `func layoutLayers(superview: UIView)` - Called when layoutSubviews method is called. Here you want to implement layout changes and add your layers or views to view.

##Requirements

*	Xcode 6
*	iOS 8.0
